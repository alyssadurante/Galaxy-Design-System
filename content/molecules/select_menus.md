1. <strong>1. Field Label</strong>: should indicate what information the field requires. The label is usually left-aligned above the input area.
2. <strong>2. Text Input Field</strong>: field people click in to receive the options they can choose from. Once selected, the option will be shown in the text input.
3. <strong>3. Option</strong>: choice for the user, shown with other choices in a menu.
4. <strong>4. Menu</strong>: contains the list of all selectable items. These can be grouped into sub-categories under headings.

# Best Practices
- Order your list of options in a way that will make the most sense. This could be by the most commonly selected option or numerically.
- Limit the amount of options before the menu becomes scrollable to 6 items.

#### Simple
Simlpe select menus should be used as the default select menu. These can be used in forms or stand-alone selects. They should be used when a user is asked to select only  one option from a list of options.

#### Supported Text
Select menus with supported text should be used when options are more detailed and need further descripton. The description should be short, concise and informative.

#### Supported Text with Icon 
Select menus with supported text and icons should be used when showing different kinds of options, such as different categories. The icon will serve to distinguish between each option type.

#### Supported Text with Icon and Secondary Text
Select menus with both icons and secondary text should be used primarily in Explore (Natural Language Search). This kind of menu shows the different option items with an icon, and a further distinction with secondary text. In the case of two options of the same category, the secondary text will display the difference.
