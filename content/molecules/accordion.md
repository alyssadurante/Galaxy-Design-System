# Usage

The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.

#### When to use
- To organize related information.
- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when content is not crucial to read in full.
- When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once, like on a mobile interface or in a side panel.

- <strong>1. Header</strong>: contains the section title and is control for revealing the panel
- <strong>2. Subtitle</strong>: a description of what that specific accordion section does (optional)
- <strong>3. Icon</strong>: indicates if the panel is open or closed
- <strong>4. Panel</strong>: the section of content associated with an accordion header.

### Placement

Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a sidebar or a slideover.

# Content
### Main Elements

#### Title
- The title should be as brief as possible while still being clear and descriptive. 
- Each title should be wrapped in a role heading that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.

#### Body
- Content inside of a section may include <a href="">input groups</a>, <a href="">badges</a>, or plain text.

# States

The accordion component has two main states: **collapsed** and <strong>expanded</strong>. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.

Accordions begin by default in the collapsed state with all content panels closed, unless the accordion exists in **Explore**, in which case the *first* accordion (Measure) should be open.
